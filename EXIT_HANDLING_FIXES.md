# Exit Handling and Lock Task Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. App Reinitialization After Proper Exit
**Problem**: When exiting the app properly via settings, it would reinitialize with full protections when reopened, creating an immediate aggressive sticky behavior.

**Solution**:
- Added `PREF_PROPER_EXIT` SharedPreferences flag to track when a proper exit occurred
- Modified `onCreate()` to check this flag and use minimal initialization after proper exit
- On proper exit, the flag is set and the next startup skips aggressive protections
- Flag is automatically cleared after one minimal startup

### 2. "App is Pinned" Popup Causing Reload Loops
**Problem**: The system notification that appears when entering lock task mode would cause the app to lose focus, triggering aggressive lifecycle methods that would re-enable immersive mode, creating a reload loop.

**Solution**:
- **Delayed Lock Task Activation**: Added 2-second delay before enabling lock task to allow UI to fully initialize
- **Graceful Focus Handling**: Added 500ms delay when re-enabling immersive mode after focus change to avoid conflicts with system dialogs
- **Exit Sequence Protection**: Added `isExitingProperly` flag to prevent aggressive behavior during exit
- **Conditional Lifecycle Actions**: All aggressive lifecycle methods now check if exit is in progress

## Key Implementation Details

### Proper Exit Sequence
```kotlin
fun exitAppProperly() {
    // Set flag to prevent aggressive reinitialization
    isExitingProperly = true
    
    // Save state for next startup
    prefs.edit().putBoolean(PREF_PROPER_EXIT, true).apply()
    
    // Clean up lock task mode
    if (activityManager.lockTaskModeState != ActivityManager.LOCK_TASK_MODE_NONE) {
        stopLockTask()
    }
    
    // Clean up security components
    cleanupSecurity()
    
    // Exit cleanly
    finishAndRemoveTask()
    exitProcess(0)
}
```

### Minimal Initialization After Proper Exit
```kotlin
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    // Check if returning from proper exit
    val wasProperExit = prefs.getBoolean(PREF_PROPER_EXIT, false)
    
    if (wasProperExit) {
        // Clear flag and use minimal setup
        prefs.edit().putBoolean(PREF_PROPER_EXIT, false).apply()
        // Basic UI setup without aggressive protections
        return
    }
    
    // Normal startup with full protections
    setupStickyWindow()
    // ... rest of normal initialization
}
```

### Delayed and Conditional Lock Task
```kotlin
// Delay lock task to avoid immediate popup issues
window.decorView.post {
    window.decorView.postDelayed({
        attemptLockTaskIfNeeded()
    }, 2000) // 2 second delay
}

private fun attemptLockTaskIfNeeded() {
    // Don't enable if exiting properly
    if (isExitingProperly) return
    
    // Rest of lock task logic...
}
```

### Protected Lifecycle Methods
All aggressive lifecycle methods now include:
```kotlin
if (isExitingProperly) {
    Log.d(TAG, "In proper exit sequence - skipping aggressive actions")
    return
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Clean Exit Experience**: Users can exit via settings and restart normally without immediate aggressive behavior
2. **No More "App is Pinned" Loops**: Delayed activation and graceful focus handling prevent reload loops
3. **Toddler-Friendly Return**: After proper exit, the app starts normally and only becomes protective after user interaction
4. **Maintained Security**: All security features remain intact during normal operation
5. **Graceful System Dialog Handling**: System notifications and dialogs no longer cause instability

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test proper exit via settings → restart app → verify normal startup
2. Test that protection re-engages after normal interaction post-restart
3. Verify "App is Pinned" notification doesn't cause loops
4. Confirm lock task still prevents swipe-away during normal operation
5. Test focus changes don't cause excessive immersive mode re-enabling
