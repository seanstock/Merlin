# Details:
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

1. **GameBridge.kt** - JavaScript Bridge Interface:
   - Enhanced communication with gameCompleted(success, timeMs, score)
   - Progress tracking with updateProgress(progressPercent)
   - Error reporting with reportError(errorMessage)
   - Debug logging with logDebug(message)
   - App info exchange with getAppInfo()
   - Comprehensive error handling and validation

2. **GameWebView.kt** - Secure WebView Composable:
   - Advanced security configuration (disabled file access, geolocation, etc.)
   - Content Security Policy injection
   - Origin whitelisting for navigation control
   - JavaScript interface restrictions with GameBridge.BRIDGE_NAME
   - Console logging integration and error handling
   - Loading states and error display UI
   - Anti-tampering measures (disabled context menu, text selection, drag/drop)
   - Security script injection for additional protection

3. **GameResultHandler.kt** - Game Result Processing:
   - Sophisticated score calculation with time bonuses and level multipliers
   - Performance rating system (EXCELLENT, GOOD, AVERAGE, NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT, FAILED)
   - Asynchronous result processing with coroutines
   - Database integration preparation (ready for actual repository)
   - Game statistics tracking and analysis

4. **GameManager.kt** - Performance & Resource Management:
   - Automatic game discovery from assets directory
   - WebView pooling for optimal performance (configurable pool size)
   - Game preloading system with intelligent caching
   - Resource cleanup and memory management
   - Game metadata cataloging and management

5. **GameScreen.kt** - Complete UI Integration:
   - Game selection interface with rich metadata display
   - Integrated gameplay experience with native UI
   - Real-time result display with performance metrics
   - Level progression system with next level functionality
   - Navigation, restart, and game management controls

6. **Sample Game Implementation** - "Merlin's Memory":
   - Complete HTML/JavaScript memory game with progressive difficulty
   - Full JavaScript bridge integration with all communication methods
   - Mobile-optimized responsive design with touch controls
   - Progress reporting and comprehensive error handling
   - Security measures and anti-tampering protection
   - Level-based URL parameter support

# Test Strategy:
Test JavaScript bridge by simulating game completions with the enhanced GameBridge interface. Verify all security measures prevent unauthorized access, including Content Security Policy, origin whitelisting, and anti-tampering measures. Test game loading performance with the WebView pooling system across different device capabilities. Validate game result processing with the performance rating system and score calculations. Test the complete UI integration with game selection, gameplay, and result display.
