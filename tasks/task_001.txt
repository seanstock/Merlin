<info added on 2025-05-27T16:30:04.078Z>
The user encountered a build failure related to androidx.core dependencies requiring a higher compileSdk version. They resolved this issue by updating the app/build.gradle.kts file to set compileSdk = 35, which is necessary for compatibility with the latest androidx libraries. This adjustment ensures the project can successfully build with the required dependencies.
</info added on 2025-05-27T16:30:04.078Z>
<info added on 2025-05-27T16:33:07.679Z>
The user has made additional configuration corrections to resolve build errors. They updated the app/build.gradle.kts file with proper compileSdk and targetSdk settings, and created a standard AndroidManifest.xml file in the app/src/main/directory to address the missing manifest error. These changes should address the initial build failures. The next step is for the user to sync the project with Gradle files, clean the project, and perform a rebuild to verify that all configuration issues have been resolved.

<info added on 2025-05-27T16:49:34.477Z>
The user has organized the project by moving it into a dedicated Merlin folder within their workspace. They've updated the Merlin/app/build.gradle.kts file to set both compileSdk and targetSdk to 35, which addresses the compatibility requirements for the latest androidx libraries. The AndroidManifest.xml file is confirmed to be in place. These organizational and configuration steps help establish a proper foundation for the project structure.

<info added on 2025-05-27T16:52:43.504Z>
The user has fixed the Gradle configuration by modifying the root build.gradle.kts file. They properly applied the 'apply false' flag to the plugins section and removed the android configuration block from the root build file. This change ensures that only the ':app' module is treated as an application module, which successfully resolves the previous "missing manifest" error. This correction follows best practices for multi-module Android project configuration.

### Description: Set up all required external libraries and dependencies in the Gradle build files
### Details:
Add dependencies for: OpenAI Java SDK, SQLCipher for encryption, Room for database access, Jetpack Compose UI components, MPAndroidChart for data visualization, Apache PDFBox for PDF manipulation, and WorkManager for background tasks. Configure version catalogs for dependency management. Set up Compose compiler options for optimal performance.
<info added on 2025-05-27T16:56:29.567Z>
Added version catalog entries in the libs.versions.toml file for all required dependencies including OpenAI SDK, SQLCipher, Room, MPAndroidChart, PDFBox, and WorkManager. Applied the kapt plugin for annotation processing. Updated app/build.gradle.kts with necessary plugins (kotlin-kapt) and configured all dependencies with proper implementation statements. Verified that all dependencies resolve correctly with no version conflicts.
</info added on 2025-05-27T16:56:29.567Z>

## 3. Implement Modular Project Structure [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Organize the project into modules to support clean architecture and future local AI integration
### Details:
Create separate modules for: core (common utilities), data (repositories and data sources), domain (business logic), ui (Compose UI components), and feature modules. Set up proper module dependencies. Configure each module with its own build.gradle file. Prepare architecture for future local AI integration with appropriate interfaces and abstractions.
<info added on 2025-05-27T18:45:24.145Z>
Created new modules (core, data, domain, ui) with basic build.gradle.kts files. Updated settings.gradle.kts to include these modules. Updated app module to depend on new modules. User to sync and rebuild project to ensure all dependencies are properly resolved.
</info added on 2025-05-27T18:45:24.145Z>
<info added on 2025-05-27T18:48:44.574Z>
Added android-library plugin alias to libs.versions.toml. Updated build.gradle.kts files for data, core, and ui modules to use the correct alias for android.library plugin instead of direct plugin reference. This resolves the 'Unresolved reference: library' error that was occurring during build. Project structure now properly configured with consistent plugin usage across modules.
</info added on 2025-05-27T18:48:44.574Z>
<info added on 2025-05-27T18:50:37.241Z>
Changed plugin application syntax in core, data, and ui modules from alias-based to explicit id-based format (id("com.android.library")) to resolve the 'plugin already on classpath' version conflict. This approach ensures each module uses a consistent plugin version and prevents classpath conflicts during build time. User should sync and rebuild the project to verify the resolution.
</info added on 2025-05-27T18:50:37.241Z>
<info added on 2025-05-27T18:51:46.745Z>
Added kotlin-jvm plugin alias (kotlin-jvm = { id = "org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm", version.ref = "kotlin" }) to libs.versions.toml to resolve plugin reference error in the domain module. This allows the domain module to properly apply the Kotlin JVM plugin using the centralized version management. User should sync and rebuild the project to apply these changes.
</info added on 2025-05-27T18:51:46.745Z>
<info added on 2025-05-27T18:53:08.560Z>
Changed org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm plugin in domain module to be id-based (id("org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm")) to resolve 'already on classpath' version conflict, similar to the approach used for other modules. This ensures consistent plugin version usage across all modules and prevents classpath conflicts during build time. User to sync and rebuild project to verify the resolution.
</info added on 2025-05-27T18:53:08.560Z>
<info added on 2025-05-27T18:54:58.961Z>
Corrected jvmTarget configuration in domain module's build.gradle.kts using tasks.withType<KotlinCompile> { kotlinOptions.jvmTarget = "17" } instead of the Android-specific kotlinOptions block. This approach is required for pure Kotlin JVM modules that don't use the Android Gradle plugin. The change resolves the 'Unresolved reference: kotlinOptions/jvmTarget' error that was occurring during build. Project now has consistent Java compatibility settings across all modules.

## 4. Configure Security Settings and ProGuard Rules [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Set up security configurations including ProGuard rules for code obfuscation
### Details:
Create ProGuard configuration files for each module. Define rules for keeping necessary classes while obfuscating others. Add specific rules for external libraries (OpenAI SDK, SQLCipher, Room, etc.). Configure R8 for code shrinking. Set up security configurations for SQLCipher database encryption. Implement proper key management strategies.
<info added on 2025-05-27T19:03:53.627Z>
Enabled R8/ProGuard for app module release builds. Created empty consumer-rules.pro files for core, data, domain, and ui modules. This completes the initial ProGuard setup. Note that specific rules for external libraries (OpenAI SDK, SQLCipher, Room) and advanced security configurations for SQLCipher database encryption will be handled in later tasks. Users should sync and rebuild the project to verify the configuration is working properly.
</info added on 2025-05-27T19:03:53.627Z>

## 5. Set Up Version Control and Build Variants [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Initialize Git repository and configure development, staging, and production build variants
### Details:
Initialize Git repository with appropriate .gitignore file to exclude build artifacts, local properties, and sensitive information. Create development, staging, and production build variants with different application IDs, server endpoints, and logging levels. Configure product flavors and build types in Gradle. Set up CI/CD pipeline configuration files if needed.
