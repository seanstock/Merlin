# Title: Screen-Time Economy and Gamification System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the screen-time wallet, badges, XP system, and adaptive difficulty mechanism to maintain ~80% task success rate, following the 'Internal-First, External-Ready' service-oriented architecture.
# Details:
# Service-Oriented Architecture Approach

- Design all economy services with external API interfaces from day 1
- Implement locally first for rapid development and testing
- Use dependency injection for easy swapping between local/remote implementations
- Structure code to support future extraction to Hostinger VPS
- Build standardized educational content contracts for third-party integration

## Architecture Layers
1. **Service Layer**: Pure DTOs with no Android dependencies, fully serializable
2. **Repository Layer**: Maps between service DTOs and database entities
3. **Database Layer**: Room entities for local persistence

## Core Economy Design
- Base unit: 1 Second = 1 Merlin Coin (MC)
- Display format: Show both MC and time equivalent (e.g., "900 MC (15m)") to help with mental calculation

## Earning Mechanisms
- Basic tasks: 30-60 MC
- Perfect completion: 1.5x multiplier
- First try bonus: +15 MC
- New concepts: 2x multiplier
- Teaching mode: +30 MC bonus
- AI coin granting: 1-10 MC per interaction (up to 60 MC daily)
- Daily caps by age group:
  * 3-5 years: 1,800 MC (30 min)
  * 6-8 years: 2,700 MC (45 min)
  * 9-12 years: 3,600 MC (60 min)

## Spending Categories
- Entertainment: 1:1 ratio (1 MC = 1 second)
- Educational games: 0.8:1 discount (1 MC = 1.25 seconds)
- Creative apps: 0.7:1 discount (1 MC = 1.43 seconds)
- Physical activity: 0.5:1 discount (1 MC = 2 seconds)
- Customization unlocks: 300-900 MC
- Learning enhancements: Unlimited spending

## Real-World Value
- Integration with Task 22 (Amazon Affiliate)
- Conversion rate: 25:1 MC-to-cents (2,500 MC = $1)

## Implementation

1. Define Service DTOs (Pure, no Android dependencies):
```kotlin
data class TransactionDto(
    val id: String,  // UUID string, not auto-generated Long
    val childId: String,
    val amount: Int,
    val category: String,
    val description: String,
    val timestamp: String,  // ISO 8601 string
    val metadata: Map<String, String> = emptyMap()
)

data class BalanceDto(
    val childId: String,
    val balance: Int,
    val dailyCap: Int,
    val todayEarned: Int,
    val todaySpent: Int
)

data class BadgeDto(
    val id: String,
    val childId: String,
    val name: String,
    val description: String,
    val earnedAt: String,  // ISO 8601 string
    val category: String,
    val imageUrl: String,
    val benefits: Map<String, String> = emptyMap()
)

    suspend fun getRemainingGameEarnings(childId: String): Result<Int>
    suspend fun awardGameCoins(childId: String, amount: Int, reason: String): Result<BalanceDto>
}

interface BadgeService {
    suspend fun awardBadge(badge: BadgeDto): Result<BadgeDto>
    suspend fun getBadges(childId: String): Result<List<BadgeDto>>
    suspend fun hasBadge(childId: String, badgeId: String): Result<Boolean>
}

interface ExperienceService {
    suspend fun awardXp(childId: String, amount: Int, source: String): Result<ExperienceDto>
    suspend fun getExperience(childId: String): Result<ExperienceDto>
}

interface AdaptiveDifficultyService {
    suspend fun calculateTaskDifficulty(childId: String, subject: String): Result<Int>
    suspend fun recordTaskResult(childId: String, subject: String, difficulty: Int, success: Boolean): Result<Unit>
    suspend fun getPerformanceStats(childId: String, subject: String): Result<PerformanceStatsDto>
}

interface ScreenTimeService {
    suspend fun getTodayScreenTime(): Result<Long>
    suspend fun getCurrentSessionTime(): Result<Long>
    suspend fun getHistoricalUsage(days: Int): Result<Map<String, Long>>
    suspend fun formatTimeHumanReadable(timeInMillis: Long): String
}
```

<info added on 2025-06-10T01:12:39.584Z>
IMPLEMENTATION STATUS UPDATE:

Critical gap identified in ChatViewModel.handleFunctionCall() - currently only handles launch_game function but missing essential handlers for:
- grant_coins: AI cannot award bonus coins despite having the function definition
- check_coins: AI cannot respond to balance inquiries 
- check_screen_time: AI cannot provide usage information

Root cause: Function definitions exist in MerlinToolExecutor and Economy service is implemented, but ChatViewModel lacks the execution bridge between AI function calls and actual service methods.

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
Implement missing function call handlers in ChatViewModel.kt:
1. Add grant_coins handler to call EconomyService.awardGameCoins()
2. Add check_coins handler to call EconomyService coin balance methods
3. Add check_screen_time handler to call ScreenTimeTracker methods
4. Ensure proper error handling and user feedback for each handler

This is blocking AI economy integration - without these handlers, the AI cannot interact with the coin system despite all backend infrastructure being ready.

FAKE TESTS ELIMINATED:

Deleted LockScreenIntegrationTest.kt and ChatScreenTest.kt which contained meaningless 'concept tests' that just asserted hardcoded true values. These tests provided false security and no real value by creating the illusion of test coverage without actually testing any functionality.

CHANGES MADE:
- Removed LockScreenIntegrationTest.kt with fake assertions
- Removed ChatScreenTest.kt with meaningless hardcoded tests
- Verified build continues to pass after removal

FAKE TESTS ELIMINATED:

Deleted LockScreenIntegrationTest.kt and ChatScreenTest.kt which contained meaningless 'concept tests' that just asserted hardcoded true values. These tests provided false security and no real value by creating the illusion of test coverage without actually testing any functionality.

CHANGES MADE:
- Removed LockScreenIntegrationTest.kt with fake assertions
- Removed ChatScreenTest.kt with meaningless hardcoded tests
- Verified build continues to pass after removal
- Confirmed remaining unit tests still execute successfully

BENEFITS:
- Eliminated false sense of security from fake test coverage
- Improved test suite honesty about actual coverage levels
- Reduced maintenance overhead from meaningless test files
- Focused testing efforts on real functionality validation

STATUS: Fake tests removed, build verified, test suite now accurately reflects genuine coverage.

REDUNDANT GAME LAUNCH LOGIC ELIMINATED:

Removed brittle keyword detection methods (shouldLaunchGame, extractGameId) from ChatViewModel that relied on primitive text matching. System now exclusively uses robust AI function-calling via MerlinToolExecutor for game launches.

CHANGES MADE:
- Deleted shouldLaunchGame method with unreliable keyword detection
- Removed extractGameId method that parsed game names from text
- Eliminated false positive game launches from casual conversation
- Streamlined game launch flow to use only AI function calls

IMPROVEMENTS:
- Game launches now require explicit AI decision via start_game function
- Enhanced context understanding through AI intelligence vs text matching
- Reduced accidental game launches from unrelated conversations
- Improved reliability by leveraging structured function calling

TECHNICAL BENEFITS:
- Eliminated maintenance overhead from keyword list management
- Removed brittle string parsing logic prone to edge cases
- Centralized game launch logic through MerlinToolExecutor
- Enhanced system robustness through AI-driven decision making

STATUS: Keyword detection removed, AI function-calling now exclusive method for game launches.

ZOMBIE CODE CLEANUP:

Successfully removed legitimate zombie code from the codebase while preserving valid assets. Conducted thorough analysis to distinguish between truly unused code and actively referenced resources.

REMOVED ZOMBIE CODE:
- Deleted lock_screen_overlay.xml - confirmed 0 references, remnant from deprecated overlay architecture
- Removed unused package-related actions from ScreenStateReceiver manifest (PACKAGE_ADDED/REMOVED/REPLACED) - actions declared but not handled in implementation code

PRESERVED VALID ASSETS:
- Retained button_primary.xml, button_secondary.xml, countdown_background.xml - all actively referenced in SecurityLockoutActivity XML layout
- Verified these resources are legitimate dependencies, not zombie code

VERIFICATION:
- Build confirmed successful after cleanup
- No broken references or missing resource errors
- Codebase reduced without functionality impact

BENEFITS:
- Reduced APK size by eliminating unused layout files
- Simplified manifest by removing unhandled broadcast actions
- Improved code maintainability through dead code elimination
- Enhanced build performance with fewer unused resources

STATUS: Zombie code successfully identified and removed, valid assets preserved, build integrity maintained.
