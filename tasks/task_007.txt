# Task ID: 7
# Title: Screen-Time Economy and Gamification System
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the screen-time wallet, badges, XP system, and adaptive difficulty mechanism to maintain ~80% task success rate, following the 'Internal-First, External-Ready' service-oriented architecture.
# Details:
# Service-Oriented Architecture Approach

- Design all economy services with external API interfaces from day 1
- Implement locally first for rapid development and testing
- Use dependency injection for easy swapping between local/remote implementations
- Structure code to support future extraction to Hostinger VPS
- Build standardized educational content contracts for third-party integration

## Architecture Layers
1. **Service Layer**: Pure DTOs with no Android dependencies, fully serializable
2. **Repository Layer**: Maps between service DTOs and database entities
3. **Database Layer**: Room entities for local persistence

## Core Economy Design
- Base unit: 1 Second = 1 Merlin Coin (MC)
- Display format: Show both MC and time equivalent (e.g., "900 MC (15m)") to help with mental calculation

## Earning Mechanisms
- Basic tasks: 30-60 MC
- Perfect completion: 1.5x multiplier
- First try bonus: +15 MC
- New concepts: 2x multiplier
- Teaching mode: +30 MC bonus
- Daily caps by age group:
  * 3-5 years: 1,800 MC (30 min)
  * 6-8 years: 2,700 MC (45 min)
  * 9-12 years: 3,600 MC (60 min)

## Spending Categories
- Entertainment: 1:1 ratio (1 MC = 1 second)
- Educational games: 0.8:1 discount (1 MC = 1.25 seconds)
- Creative apps: 0.7:1 discount (1 MC = 1.43 seconds)
- Physical activity: 0.5:1 discount (1 MC = 2 seconds)
- Customization unlocks: 300-900 MC
- Learning enhancements: Unlimited spending

## Real-World Value
- Integration with Task 22 (Amazon Affiliate)
- Conversion rate: 25:1 MC-to-cents (2,500 MC = $1)

## Implementation

1. Define Service DTOs (Pure, no Android dependencies):
```kotlin
data class TransactionDto(
    val id: String,  // UUID string, not auto-generated Long
    val childId: String,
    val amount: Int,
    val category: String,
    val description: String,
    val timestamp: String,  // ISO 8601 string
    val metadata: Map<String, String> = emptyMap()
)

data class BalanceDto(
    val childId: String,
    val balance: Int,
    val dailyCap: Int,
    val todayEarned: Int,
    val todaySpent: Int
)

data class BadgeDto(
    val id: String,
    val childId: String,
    val name: String,
    val description: String,
    val earnedAt: String,  // ISO 8601 string
    val category: String,
    val imageUrl: String,
    val benefits: Map<String, String> = emptyMap()
)

data class ExperienceDto(
    val childId: String,
    val level: Int,
    val currentXp: Int,
    val nextLevelXp: Int,
    val totalXpEarned: Int
)

data class PerformanceStatsDto(
    val childId: String,
    val subject: String,
    val successRate: Float,
    val averageDifficulty: Float,
    val tasksCompleted: Int,
    val lastUpdated: String  // ISO 8601 string
)
```

2. Define Service Interfaces (Pure business logic contracts):
```kotlin
interface EconomyService {
    suspend fun recordTransaction(transaction: TransactionDto): Result<TransactionDto>
    suspend fun getBalance(childId: String): Result<BalanceDto>
    suspend fun getTransactionHistory(childId: String): Result<List<TransactionDto>>
    suspend fun getDailyCapByAge(age: Int): Result<Int>
    suspend fun calculateReward(difficulty: Int, isFirstTry: Boolean, isPerfect: Boolean, isNewConcept: Boolean, isTeachingMode: Boolean): Result<Int>
    suspend fun convertToRealWorldValue(coins: Int): Result<Float>
}

interface BadgeService {
    suspend fun awardBadge(badge: BadgeDto): Result<BadgeDto>
    suspend fun getBadges(childId: String): Result<List<BadgeDto>>
    suspend fun hasBadge(childId: String, badgeId: String): Result<Boolean>
}

interface ExperienceService {
    suspend fun awardXp(childId: String, amount: Int, source: String): Result<ExperienceDto>
    suspend fun getExperience(childId: String): Result<ExperienceDto>
}

interface AdaptiveDifficultyService {
    suspend fun calculateTaskDifficulty(childId: String, subject: String): Result<Int>
    suspend fun recordTaskResult(childId: String, subject: String, difficulty: Int, success: Boolean): Result<Unit>
    suspend fun getPerformanceStats(childId: String, subject: String): Result<PerformanceStatsDto>
}
```

3. Local Service Implementations:
```kotlin
class LocalEconomyService(private val repository: EconomyRepository) : EconomyService {
    override suspend fun recordTransaction(transaction: TransactionDto): Result<TransactionDto> {
        return repository.insertTransaction(transaction)
    }
    
    override suspend fun getBalance(childId: String): Result<BalanceDto> {
        return repository.getBalance(childId)
    }
    
    override suspend fun getTransactionHistory(childId: String): Result<List<TransactionDto>> {
        return repository.getTransactionHistory(childId)
    }
    
    override suspend fun getDailyCapByAge(age: Int): Result<Int> {
        val cap = when {
            age <= 5 -> 1800  // 30 minutes
            age <= 8 -> 2700  // 45 minutes
            else -> 3600      // 60 minutes
        }
        return Result.success(cap)
    }
    
    override suspend fun calculateReward(difficulty: Int, isFirstTry: Boolean, isPerfect: Boolean, isNewConcept: Boolean, isTeachingMode: Boolean): Result<Int> {
        var baseReward = when(difficulty) {
            1 -> 30
            2 -> 40
            3 -> 50
            else -> 60
        }
        
        // Apply multipliers
        if (isPerfect) baseReward = (baseReward * 1.5).toInt()
        if (isNewConcept) baseReward *= 2
        
        // Apply bonuses
        var totalReward = baseReward
        if (isFirstTry) totalReward += 15
        if (isTeachingMode) totalReward += 30
        
        return Result.success(totalReward)
    }
    
    override suspend fun convertToRealWorldValue(coins: Int): Result<Float> {
        // Convert MC to cents at 25:1 ratio
        return Result.success(coins / 25f)
    }
}

class LocalAdaptiveDifficultyService(private val repository: PerformanceRepository) : AdaptiveDifficultyService {
    override suspend fun calculateTaskDifficulty(childId: String, subject: String): Result<Int> {
        return repository.calculateTaskDifficulty(childId, subject)
    }
    
    override suspend fun recordTaskResult(childId: String, subject: String, difficulty: Int, success: Boolean): Result<Unit> {
        return repository.recordTaskResult(childId, subject, difficulty, success)
    }
    
    override suspend fun getPerformanceStats(childId: String, subject: String): Result<PerformanceStatsDto> {
        return repository.getPerformanceStats(childId, subject)
    }
}
```

4. Repository Layer (Maps DTOs to Entities):
```kotlin
class EconomyRepository(private val transactionDao: TransactionDao, private val balanceDao: BalanceDao) {
    suspend fun insertTransaction(dto: TransactionDto): Result<TransactionDto> {
        val entity = dto.toEntity()
        val id = transactionDao.insert(entity)
        return Result.success(dto.copy(id = id.toString()))
    }
    
    suspend fun getBalance(childId: String): Result<BalanceDto> {
        val entity = balanceDao.getBalanceForChild(childId) ?: BalanceEntity(
            childId = childId,
            balance = 0,
            dailyCap = 0,
            todayEarned = 0,
            todaySpent = 0
        )
        return Result.success(entity.toDto())
    }
    
    suspend fun getTransactionHistory(childId: String): Result<List<TransactionDto>> {
        val entities = transactionDao.getTransactionsForChild(childId)
        return Result.success(entities.map { it.toDto() })
    }
}

class PerformanceRepository(private val performanceDao: PerformanceDao) {
    suspend fun calculateTaskDifficulty(childId: String, subject: String): Result<Int> {
        val recentTasks = performanceDao.getRecentTasks(childId, subject, 10)
        val successRate = if (recentTasks.isEmpty()) 0.8f else 
            recentTasks.count { it.success } / recentTasks.size.toFloat()
        
        val currentDifficulty = performanceDao.getCurrentDifficulty(childId, subject) ?: 1
        
        val newDifficulty = when {
            successRate > 0.9 -> currentDifficulty + 1
            successRate < 0.7 -> maxOf(1, currentDifficulty - 1)
            else -> currentDifficulty
        }
        
        return Result.success(newDifficulty)
    }
    
    suspend fun recordTaskResult(childId: String, subject: String, difficulty: Int, success: Boolean): Result<Unit> {
        val entity = TaskResultEntity(
            id = UUID.randomUUID().toString(),
            childId = childId,
            subject = subject,
            difficulty = difficulty,
            success = success,
            timestamp = Instant.now().toString()
        )
        performanceDao.insert(entity)
        return Result.success(Unit)
    }
    
    suspend fun getPerformanceStats(childId: String, subject: String): Result<PerformanceStatsDto> {
        val stats = performanceDao.getPerformanceStats(childId, subject)
        return Result.success(stats.toDto())
    }
}
```

5. Database Layer (Room Entities):
```kotlin
@Entity(tableName = "transactions")
data class TransactionEntity(
    @PrimaryKey val id: String,  // Store UUID from service
    val childId: String,
    val amount: Int,
    val category: String,
    val description: String,
    val timestamp: String,  // Store ISO string
    val metadata: String  // JSON blob
)

@Entity(tableName = "balances")
data class BalanceEntity(
    @PrimaryKey val childId: String,
    val balance: Int,
    val dailyCap: Int,
    val todayEarned: Int,
    val todaySpent: Int
)

@Entity(tableName = "badges")
data class BadgeEntity(
    @PrimaryKey val id: String,
    val childId: String,
    val name: String,
    val description: String,

)

@Entity(tableName = "task_results")
data class TaskResultEntity(
    @PrimaryKey val id: String,
    val childId: String,
    val subject: String,
    val difficulty: Int,
    val success: Boolean,
    val timestamp: String
)

@Entity(tableName = "performance_stats")
data class PerformanceStatsEntity(
    @PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true) val id: Long = 0,
    val childId: String,
    val subject: String,
    val successRate: Float,
    val averageDifficulty: Float,
    val tasksCompleted: Int,
    val lastUpdated: String
)
```

6. Remote Service Implementation (for future):
```kotlin
class RemoteEconomyService(private val apiClient: ApiClient) : EconomyService {
    override suspend fun recordTransaction(transaction: TransactionDto): Result<TransactionDto> {
        return apiClient.post("/api/v1/transactions", transaction)
    }
    
    override suspend fun getBalance(childId: String): Result<BalanceDto> {
        return apiClient.get("/api/v1/balances/$childId")
    }
    
    override suspend fun getTransactionHistory(childId: String): Result<List<TransactionDto>> {
        return apiClient.get("/api/v1/transactions?childId=$childId")
    }
    
    override suspend fun getDailyCapByAge(age: Int): Result<Int> {
        return apiClient.get("/api/v1/caps?age=$age")
    }
    
    override suspend fun calculateReward(difficulty: Int, isFirstTry: Boolean, isPerfect: Boolean, isNewConcept: Boolean, isTeachingMode: Boolean): Result<Int> {
        val params = mapOf(
            "difficulty" to difficulty.toString(),
            "isFirstTry" to isFirstTry.toString(),
            "isPerfect" to isPerfect.toString(),
            "isNewConcept" to isNewConcept.toString(),
            "isTeachingMode" to isTeachingMode.toString()
        )
        return apiClient.get("/api/v1/rewards/calculate", params)
    }
    
    override suspend fun convertToRealWorldValue(coins: Int): Result<Float> {
        return apiClient.get("/api/v1/convert?coins=$coins")
    }
}
```

7. Dependency Injection Module:
```kotlin
@Module
@InstallIn(SingletonComponent::class)
class ServiceModule {
    @Provides
    @Singleton
    fun provideEconomyService(repository: EconomyRepository): EconomyService {
        return if (BuildConfig.USE_REMOTE) {
            RemoteEconomyService(ApiClient())
        } else {
            LocalEconomyService(repository)
        }
    }
    
    @Provides
    @Singleton
    fun provideAdaptiveDifficultyService(repository: PerformanceRepository): AdaptiveDifficultyService {
        return if (BuildConfig.USE_REMOTE) {
            RemoteAdaptiveDifficultyService(ApiClient())
        } else {
            LocalAdaptiveDifficultyService(repository)
        }
    }
    
    @Provides
    @Singleton
    fun provideBadgeService(repository: BadgeRepository): BadgeService {
        return if (BuildConfig.USE_REMOTE) {
            RemoteBadgeService(ApiClient())
        } else {
            LocalBadgeService(repository)
        }
    }
    
    @Provides
    @Singleton
    fun provideExperienceService(repository: ExperienceRepository): ExperienceService {
        return if (BuildConfig.USE_REMOTE) {
            RemoteExperienceService(ApiClient())
        } else {
            LocalExperienceService(repository)
        }
    }
}
```

8. DTO ↔ Entity Mapping Extensions:
```kotlin
// Extension functions for mapping between DTOs and Entities
fun TransactionDto.toEntity(): TransactionEntity {
    return TransactionEntity(
        id = this.id,
        childId = this.childId,
        amount = this.amount,
        category = this.category,
        description = this.description,
        timestamp = this.timestamp,
        metadata = Json.encodeToString(this.metadata)
    )
}

fun TransactionEntity.toDto(): TransactionDto {
    return TransactionDto(
        id = this.id,
        childId = this.childId,
        amount = this.amount,
        category = this.category,
        description = this.description,
        timestamp = this.timestamp,
        metadata = Json.decodeFromString(this.metadata)
    )
}
```

- **Isolated data layer** to work independently without DTO dependencies
- **Updated ServiceModule** to provide individual repositories instead of unified service

### **2. Repository Method Fixes:**
- **BalanceRepository**: Fixed all method calls to match actual DAO signatures, added required timestamp parameters
- **BadgeRepository**: Removed non-existent methods, kept only valid DAO methods
- **ExperienceRepository**: Updated method signatures to match DAO interface
- **Removed invalid method calls** that were causing compilation errors

### **3. Database Integration:**
- **MerlinDatabase.kt**: Already properly configured with all entities and DAOs
- **Individual repositories**: Now working correctly with their respective DAOs
- **ServiceModule**: Provides direct repository access as workaround

## **Current Status:**
✅ **Foundation layer is now stable and buildable**
✅ **Individual repositories are fully functional**
✅ **Database schema is complete and integrated**
✅ **Dependency injection provides repository access**

## **Next Steps for Full Integration:**
1. **Configure module dependencies** to allow data module to import app DTOs
2. **Re-enable EconomyRepository** and mapping functions
3. **Implement service layer** that uses the unified repository
4. **Add proper error handling** with Result types

The foundation is solid and ready for the next development phase!
