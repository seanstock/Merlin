# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive testing suite including unit tests, integration tests, and UI tests to ensure app reliability and performance.
# Details:
1. Create unit test suite for core components:
```kotlin
class AIInteractionManagerTest {
    @Test
    fun `processInteraction stores chat history correctly`() {
        // Test implementation
    }
    
    @Test
    fun `processInteraction falls back to local tasks on API failure`() {
        // Test implementation
    }
}
```

2. Implement integration tests for key workflows:
```kotlin
class ProfileWorkflowTest {
    @Test
    fun `complete profile creation and switching workflow`() {
        // Test implementation
    }
}
```

3. Create UI tests with Compose testing:
```kotlin
class LockScreenTest {
    @Test
    fun `lock screen displays correct components`() {
        composeTestRule.setContent {
            LockScreen(viewModel)
        }
        
        composeTestRule.onNodeWithText("Hello").assertIsDisplayed()
    }
}
```

4. Implement performance testing
5. Create security audit tests
6. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

# Test Strategy:
Run unit tests on each build. Execute integration tests daily. Perform UI tests before each release. Conduct performance testing with different device profiles. Complete security audit before production release.
