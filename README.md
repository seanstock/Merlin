# Merlin - AI-Powered Educational Companion for Children

Merlin is an Android application that provides personalized AI tutoring and educational experiences for children. The app combines advanced AI interaction capabilities with intelligent memory systems to create engaging, adaptive learning experiences.

## üåü Key Features

### üîí Lock Screen Overlay Service
Our app includes a sophisticated lock screen overlay system that ensures focused learning sessions:

- **Accessibility Service Integration**: Uses Android's AccessibilityService to monitor system events and manage screen interactions
- **System Alert Window**: Creates persistent overlays that remain visible across all apps
- **Touch Event Consumption**: Prevents users from bypassing the learning session by consuming touch events
- **Broadcast Receiver**: Monitors screen on/off events to manage overlay visibility
- **Foreground Service**: Ensures the overlay remains active with a persistent notification
- **Permission Management**: Handles SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permissions with user-friendly prompts

### üß† Intelligent AI Interaction System
The heart of Merlin is its sophisticated AI interaction system that provides personalized tutoring:

#### How Our AI Memory System Works
Our app remembers everything important about each child's learning journey:

- **Smart Memory Storage**: We automatically detect and store significant interactions (like when a child expresses preferences, struggles with concepts, or achieves milestones)
- **Memory Types**: We categorize memories into 7 types:
  - **Preferences**: What the child likes/dislikes ("I love math games!")
  - **Emotional**: How the child feels ("I'm scared of fractions")
  - **Educational**: Learning-related content ("I want to learn about space")
  - **Personal**: Family and personal details ("My mom is a teacher")
  - **Achievements**: Successes and accomplishments ("I got 100% on my quiz!")
  - **Difficulties**: Challenges and struggles ("Math is really hard for me")
  - **General**: Other important information

#### How Our Scoring System Works
We use a sophisticated scoring system to determine what's worth remembering:

- **Significance Detection**: We analyze conversations using multiple factors:
  - **Content Analysis**: Looking for important keywords and topics
  - **Emotional Weight**: Emotional content gets higher scores (1.5x multiplier)
  - **Personal Information**: Personal details get priority (1.3x multiplier)
  - **Educational Content**: Learning-related discussions get boosted (1.1x multiplier)
  - **Question-Answer Patterns**: Interactive conversations score higher (1.2x multiplier)
  - **Message Length**: Substantial conversations get more weight
  - **Sentiment Analysis**: Emotionally charged content is prioritized

#### How Memory Retrieval Works
When a child talks to Merlin, we intelligently retrieve relevant memories:

- **Keyword Matching**: We extract meaningful keywords (filtering out common words like "the", "and")
- **Recency Scoring**: Recent memories get higher priority:
  - Last day: 100% relevance
  - Last week: 80% relevance
  - Last month: 60% relevance
  - Older: 20% relevance
- **Importance Scoring**: Memories are rated 1-5 stars based on significance
- **Context Matching**: We match memory types to current conversation topics
- **Smart Caching**: We cache retrieval results for 5 minutes to improve performance

### üéØ Personalized AI Responses
Our AI system creates truly personalized interactions:

- **Memory-Enhanced Prompts**: We include relevant memories in AI prompts so Merlin remembers past conversations
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: The system adjusts task difficulty to maintain ~80% success rate
- **Age-Appropriate Communication**: Responses are tailored to the child's age, gender, and language preferences
- **Function Calling**: Merlin can launch educational games and perform specific actions
- **Fallback Responses**: When AI is unavailable, we provide encouraging local responses

### üîß Technical Architecture

#### Database Design
We use Room database with sophisticated entity relationships:

- **Child Profiles**: Store age, preferences, location, and learning data
- **Chat History**: Complete conversation logs with timestamps
- **Memories**: Intelligent storage of significant interactions with type classification and importance ratings
- **Memory Statistics**: Analytics for tracking learning progress

#### AI Integration
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: Primary AI model for natural conversations
- **Function Tools**: Structured way for AI to trigger app actions (like launching games)
- **Context Management**: Intelligent conversation history management
- **Error Handling**: Robust retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Caching**: Response caching to improve performance and reduce API costs

#### Memory Repository Pattern
We use a clean architecture approach:

- **Repository Layer**: Abstracts database operations and provides business logic
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes old, low-importance memories to maintain performance
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient database operations for better performance
- **Statistics Tracking**: Real-time analytics on memory usage and patterns

### üß™ How We Test Everything

#### Comprehensive Testing Strategy
We believe in thorough testing to ensure reliability:

- **Unit Tests**: Every component has dedicated unit tests
- **Memory System Tests**: Extensive testing of scoring algorithms, keyword extraction, and memory formatting
- **Significance Detection Tests**: 8 test categories covering all aspects of our significance algorithm
- **Database Tests**: Verification of all database operations and entity relationships
- **AI Integration Tests**: Testing of OpenAI client functionality and error handling

#### Test Coverage Areas
- **Memory Retrieval**: Testing keyword matching, recency scoring, importance weighting
- **Conversation Management**: Testing context window management and message formatting
- **Database Operations**: Testing CRUD operations, relationships, and data integrity
- **Error Scenarios**: Testing network failures, API errors, and edge cases
- **Performance**: Testing caching, batch operations, and memory usage

### üöÄ Development Workflow

#### Task Management
We use a sophisticated task management system:

- **Hierarchical Tasks**: Main tasks broken down into detailed subtasks
- **Dependency Tracking**: Tasks have clear prerequisites and relationships
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status updates and completion tracking
- **Complexity Analysis**: AI-powered analysis of task complexity for better planning

#### Code Quality
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with clear layer boundaries
- **Dependency Injection**: Proper dependency management for testability
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly fallbacks
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching, efficient algorithms, and resource management
